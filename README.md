API trivia game 

Started coding: december 2018.

week 8 bootcamp CodeGorilla.

This week we were assigned to make our own project with things we found difficult the past weeks. 

I decided to make a trivia game with information from a API. And especially with the use of a lot of JavaScript. 

I kinda started wrong with using PHP (file still in the folder) and decided to switch it all over to JavaScript,
as this is the main thing I still find a bit difficult. 

I finnaly started with a lot of debugging (console.log) to work this script out. It still isn't working as it suppose to, 
so whenever im off im trying to work on this project bit by bit to make it a working game. 

Learning a lot in the process, and how JavaScript exactly works.
